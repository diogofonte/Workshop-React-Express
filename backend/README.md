# Backend for the TODO list application

This is a simple express.js serve used for the workshops.

The code has a few TODOs meant for you to complete the program. Good luck!

## Getting started

Just `npm install` in the repository to install the dependencies and use `npm start` to start the server. Additionally, you can run with hot reloading using nodemon by instead running it with npm `run run start:dev`.
